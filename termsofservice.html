    We, jent.ly (support@jent.ly; “developers”) developed the Chrome extension jent.ly Summarizer ("extension"; “summarizer”) which is available through our website <a href="https://jent.ly">https://jent.ly</a> and the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jently-summarizer/ljpcoibfhggflcmmlbpbcmdkmdnaafeo">Google Chrome Web Store</a>. The jent.ly Summarizer is a free extension that provides an extractive summary by highlighting key sentences on the website. Users can enable/disable the summarizer, modify the list of domains that the summarizer works on as well as customize the highlighting color and summarization parameters.
