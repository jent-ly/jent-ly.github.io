Internet web pages can be long and overly descriptive, containing lots of information not necessarily relevant to the reader. Instead of reading through every word of an article, the Jent.ly Summarizer highlights key points of an article to save your time and attention.

Our summarization technology analyses the syntax and semantics of the article to deliver a summary that is ~20% of the original article length! For technical details and source code, feel free to visit and contribute to our [GitHub Repositories](https://github.com/jent-ly).

We understand that producing a good summary is a hard task and is subjective to the reader and the context of the article. We're constantly working to make the summarization experience better (Spoiler: You'll soon be able to enter keywords that we'll find and include in our summary).

Of course, please let us know how we did from within the extension or by [email](mailto:jently.summarizer@gmail.com). Any feedback or suggestion is greatly appreciated!

Thanks for your support!

Cheers,

The Jent.ly Team
